# Advent-of-Utils

A little crate for helping my workflow for the annual Advent of Code challenge. This tool is designed to automate the process of fetching and caching puzzle inputs, making it easier to focus on solving the puzzles.

## Automation Disclaimer

This tool adheres to the automation guidelines outlined in the [Advent of Code FAQ on automation](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation/):
- The tool will only fetch the puzzle input for a day if it is not already cached locally or during controlled testing.
- Upon successfully fetching the input online, it will cache the input by default for future use.
- The User-Agent header in requests includes a reference to this repository. If there are any issues, please contact me (Itron_al_Lenn) via a platform linked in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Itron-al-Lenn).
