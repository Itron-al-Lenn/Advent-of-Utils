This tool adheres to the automation guidelines outlined in the [Advent of Code FAQ on automation](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation/):
- The tool will only fetch the puzzle input for a day if it is not already cached locally or during controlled testing.
- Upon successfully fetching the input online, it will cache the input by default for future use.
- The User-Agent header in requests includes a reference to this repository. If there are any issues, please contact me (Itron_al_Lenn) via a platform linked in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Itron-al-Lenn).
