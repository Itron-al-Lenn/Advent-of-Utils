# Introduction
`Advent of Utils` helps you solving your [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Not by implementing the solutions for you, but by handling the boilerplate work so you can focus on solving the puzzles.

# Features
- ðŸš€ Automatic input fetching with local caching
- ðŸ“Š Built-in performance benchmarking
- ðŸ”§ Simple macro-based setup
- ðŸ’¾ Session token management

# Setup

## Prerequisites
1. An Advent of Code account and session token
2. Rust toolchain installed

## Installation
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
advent-of-utils = "0.2.0"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

Install the CLI using:
```bash
cargo install advent-of-utils-cli
```

## Environment Setup

Set your Advent of Code session token:

```bash
# Linux/MacOS
export AOC_SESSION=your_session_token

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:AOC_SESSION="your_session_token"
```

You will find your session token in the cookies on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) page when you are logged in.

# Usage

## 1. Create Your Solution Structure

First, create a new Rust project for your solutions:

```bash
cargo new aoc-2023
cd aoc-2023
```

## 2. Set Up Your Project

In your project's `lib.rs`, use the `add_days!` macro to generate the boilerplate for your solutions:

```rust
use advent_of_utils::add_days;

// Generate modules for days 1 through 25
add_days!(1..=25);
```

## 3. Implement Solutions

For each day you want to solve, implement the `Solution` trait in the corresponding module. You need to create a file for all the days you added yet to your macro or the compiler will complain. Here's an example for day 1:

```rust
// src/day01.rs

use advent_of_utils::{Solution, AocOption};

pub struct Day01;

impl Solution for Day01 {
    fn part1(&self, input: String) -> AocOption {
        // Your solution for part 1
        1.into()
    }

    fn part2(&self, input: String) -> AocOption {
        // Your solution for part 2
        "part2 result".into()
    }
}
```

## 4. Run Solutions

Once your solutions are implemented and your code compiles you can run the your code through the `aou` CLI.

# CLI Reference

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Run a specific day's solution
aou run <YEAR> <DAY>

# Run all implemented solutions
aou run <YEAR>
```

For more informations on your options for the CLI run:

```bash
aou --help
```

/// A procedural macro that generates boilerplate code for Advent of Code solution modules.
///
/// This macro takes a comma-separated list of day numbers and generates:
/// - Individual modules for each day which have to be populated with your solutions
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * Takes a comma-separated list of expressions representing the day numbers (e.g., `add_days!(1..10, 12, 13)`)
///
/// # Generated Code
///
/// For each day number, the macro:
/// 1. Creates a module declaration (`mod dayXX`)
/// 3. Generates a HashMap mapping day numbers to solution implementations which is accessed by the
///    CLI
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// add_days!(1, 2, 15);
/// ```
///
/// This will generate:
/// - Modules: `mod day01;`, `mod day02;`, `mod day15;`
/// - Solution mapping in a HashMap
